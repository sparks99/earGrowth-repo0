# earGrowth-repo0
Not just another repo, it is my first!

Boo!

Do feel welcome to review the first repo made by earGrowth. I like linux, pizza and the study of oak seeds, also known as acorns. I dislike acronyms and apostrophes, but realize they are a necessary evil in this world of instant gratification.
